    This form allows users to select a set of vaccines for analysis. Return data can be filtered
    by biographical information and time of sample collection relative to vaccine exposure.
    GSM values derived from user selections will be analyzed using differential expression techniques,
    and then passed through the Reactome pathway enrichment analysis tool. </p>

    These results, along with a set of functional interactions present for any hit genes, will be displayed below the form after the analysis is
    complete.
